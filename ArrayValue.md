Regardless of the kind of data structure you work with, all data structures are expected to carry out four kinds of operations at minimum. In this video we look at the concepts behind array access.     


## Array          

```python      
new_list = [1, 2, 3]
result = new_list[10]
print(result)        

```        

We can only access index that array contains. The array does not contain index 10, so you will see the error like this `IndexError: list index out of range`.
